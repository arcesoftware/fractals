# fractals
The code uses the HTML5 canvas element to render the Fractals, and it utilizes the requestAnimationFrame() function to continuously draw new points on the canvas. It also includes a feature to plot the dots in the Fractals depending on the distance from the origin, with a color gradient that ranges from green to red.
